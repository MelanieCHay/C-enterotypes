# C-enterotypes
 
Welcome to the C-enterotypes repo. 
This repository has been created in the interests of open science and reproducibility so that anyone who reads the manuscript: Chicken caecal enterotypes in indigenous Kadaknath and commercial Cobb chicken lines are associated with Campylobacter abundance and influenced by farming practices can see, apply, edit and play with the code that was used to generate the figures and results in the paper.
